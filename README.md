# Electronic Portfolio for Rajkaran
I have built this posrtfolio using Symfony 2.7 and later on upgraded to Symfony 3.1 version. It has a public view and admin view to add any new project. This application mimics the basic content management system using Symfony framework and MySQL as a database.


## Features:
* A dynamic frontend
* Admin side to modify the content
* Implemented Authentication and Authorization
* Mobile first responsive design
* A sidebar to list all the projects
* Content section to display:
